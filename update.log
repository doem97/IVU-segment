Update Log
2018/08/05:
1.	Changed jacc_coef method in metrics.py, when it is under 0.65, an pictures' jacc score is set to 0. In case of training process entering a all-0 environment, jacc_coef_ori was kept for jacc_loss.

2018/08/06:
1.	Added comments on data_gen_args parts and added parameters:
		zca_epsilon=1e-6,
		preprocessing_function=None,

2018/08/07:
1.	Changed data division type.
	Added `project_path` to control project base path, the project should be orgnized like:
		>project_path/	>datasets/	>2017/	>Training/
											>Validation/
											>Test/
											>resized/
									>2018/
									>manu/
						>workspace/	>python files
									>update log
	So developer can control which division type using `datasets_div` of 'isic' or 'manu'.
	What's more, all resized pictures will be saved into resized/ folder, no matter which stage you are. Because former
	use can recall it from the list, it is not necessary to delete the resized/ folder. But if you 1. change the resize
	size 2. Didn't have all of pictures in resized/ folder, you should delete the folder and do retrain.
	It's hard to remember so when it goes wrong just delete resized/ folder and resize all of pics.

**CAUTION: Remember deleting resized/ folder manully in above situations.

**WARNING: We didn't used os.path.join() so it may cause problem when transplant to other OS.

2.	All models in models.py are reset to the state that uses segment only and set classification loss to 0.00.

**WARNING: Unet-2 isn't compiled with (segment_result, classification_result) output, change it when using in case of potential error.

**VERSION: We noticed that this version faces severe problem that it uses classification but in ISIC_2018 training we didn't provide with .csv file. So I decided to update the version to v2.0 and delete the classification function (while classification multi-task surely didn't give any profit.)

2018/08/08:
**UPDATED: v2.0
1.	Deleted all classification-related codes.
2.	Move VGG16_PRETRAINED_NOTOP path to train_sgmt.py and be passed by function parameter rather than a global variable in models.py.

2018/08/09:
v2.0
1.	Fix metrics bug and only calculate '0.65' rule under evaluation and test processing.

**WARNING: Version before v2.1 is unusable because of that.

2018/08/11:
v2.1
1.	Changed the data_aug_args and fit it. Test results saved in segment/log/test_v2.log

[master] v2.3 - 18/08/20
1.	Added `random_crop_image` method and added `isic_utils.py`. `random_crop_image` is used in `preprocessing_function`.
